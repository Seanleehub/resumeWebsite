We generally collect personal  information for the purposes of  responding to  enquiries. Failure to provide the  personal information requested may preclude us from  responding to your queries.</li>

                            						    <li>Clickstreams are the paths a user takes when navigating a web page  or the internet in general. When you visit the Sean Lee Resume website, our Internet Service Provider makes a record of your visit and  logs the following information for  statistical purposes – the user's server address, the user's top level  domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk, .nz, etc), the date and  time of the visit to the site, and the type of browser used.</li>
                            						    <li>A cookie is a short piece of data that is sent from a web server to  a web browser on the user's machine when the browser visits the  server's site. The cookie is stored on the user's machine, but it is  not an executable program and cannot do  anything to your machine. Whenever a web browser requests a file from  the same web server that sent the cookie, the browser sends a copy of  that cookie back to the server along with the request. In this way, the  server knows you have visited before  and can co-ordinate your access to different pages on its web site. A  server cannot find out a name or e-mail address, or anything about a  user's computer, by using cookies.</li>
                            						    <li>If you use a link on this website to access a third party website,  we recommend that you check the relevant organisation's privacy policy  on such sites before submitting any personal information.</li>
